    # 1) Winds are a giant pain. They're super fast (up to a few 
    #  1000 km/s) and they make super hot gas (up to 10^8-10^9 K) 
    # This is an issue for the Courant condition. A 3D simulation that 
    # takes 2 days without winds takes weeks with winds included
    # 2) What structures do you see evolving? How do they compare with
    #  https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1977ApJ...218..377W/abstract
    # Try turning radiation on to see what happens. Why?
    # Try plotting xHII instead of log(T) (or add a new line for it)
    # Now try setting the medium to uniform and see what happens

    # In the next example we explore saving the simulation state to file
