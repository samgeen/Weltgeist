    # This adds radiative cooling to the gas
    # Basically, various processes cause the gas to lose thermal energy
    #  to low-energy radiation
    # What happens? Why is the shell thinner?
    # 3) Explore what happens before the solution is stable
    #    Plot hydro.xhii (hydrogen ionisation fraction)
    #    The above solutions assume photoionisation equilibrium ("D-type")
